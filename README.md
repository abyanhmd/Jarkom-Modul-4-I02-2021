### VLSM - CPT

#### Subnetting
From the topology, we have made the subnet to be like the picture below.

In order to make the tree, we made subnet calculation first like the picture below.

After calculating the IP for each subnet, we can make  the tree like the picture below.

The IP of each node in the CPT should be in the range of the subnet as stated in the picture above. In this case, we made the IP to be as close as the IP Network to make it easier to remember.

#### Routing

For the routing, we couldn't make it run like it should be. We have inputted all the IP and its routing for each subnet, but the packet goes everywhere and not working properly. So, we couldn't include the screenshot of the correct one for this.
